🌊 AquaSound: Marine Noise Pollution Detection Using AI Audio Analysis
📘 Project Overview

AquaSound is an AI-based project developed during my AI/ML Internship under IBM SkillsBuild and CSRBOX.
The main goal of this project is to detect and analyze marine noise pollution using AI-powered audio analysis techniques.
By identifying harmful underwater noise patterns, AquaSound contributes to Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 14: Life Below Water — aiming to protect and conserve marine ecosystems.

🎯 Objective

To detect anthropogenic (human-made) underwater noises such as ship engines, sonar, and drilling.

To differentiate them from natural ocean sounds like marine life communication or waves.

To analyze the impact of excessive noise pollution on marine biodiversity.

⚙️ Workflow

Data Collection – Gathered underwater sound datasets (both natural and human-made).

Preprocessing – Converted audio files to spectrograms, removed noise, and normalized signals.

Feature Extraction – Used Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCC) for sound pattern recognition.

Model Training – Trained a CNN model to classify marine vs. anthropogenic noise.

Testing & Evaluation – Evaluated model accuracy and performance using confusion matrix and metrics.

Deployment – Developed a simple Streamlit-based UI for testing new underwater sounds.

🖥️ User Interface (UI)

The AquaSound app allows users to:

Upload underwater sound clips

View generated spectrograms

Get AI predictions: Marine / Human-made noise

Display accuracy score and model confidence
